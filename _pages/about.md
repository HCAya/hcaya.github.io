I am a PhD student at [Theoretical Chemistry Institute](https://tci.chem.wisc.edu/) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I study on molecular dynamics and machine learning. My PhD advisor is [Prof. Xuhui Huang](https://huang.chem.wisc.edu/).
Prior to that, I completed my BS in Chemistry at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I worked on molecular docking in [Prof. Yi Qin Gao](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/gaoyq/)'s group. 

My research focuses on developing physics-informed machine learning methods to understand complex molecular systems, particularly those in living systems. I am also interested in understanding the multiscale emergent phenomena in nature.
- **Molecular Simulation:** biomolecular dynamics, the sampling problem.
- **Machine Learning:** deep learning on graphs, generative models.
